# Evaluation of Adtech Reporting System Against Requirements

## Tech Stack Requirements
- [x] Backend: Python FastAPI
- [x] Database: MongoDB (with Beanie ODM)
- [x] Frontend: React 18+ with TypeScript
- [x] UI: Ant Design (antd)
- [x] Charts: Recharts (used in Reports.tsx)

## Data Structure
- [x] All required dimensions and metrics match the specification

## Backend Features
### Data Import System
- [x] CSV Upload API: POST /api/data/import
- [x] Data Processing: Parses CSV with pandas
- [x] Bulk Insert: Batched inserts for efficiency
- [x] Progress Tracking: Job status with progress percentage
- [x] Error Handling: Validates data, handles errors, logs issues

### Reporting APIs
- [x] POST /api/reports/query: Dynamic report generation with filters, pagination, grouping
- [x] GET /api/reports/dimensions: Lists available dimensions
- [x] GET /api/reports/metrics: Lists available metrics
- [x] POST /api/reports/export: Exports filtered data as CSV
- [x] GET /api/reports/summary: Provides overall summary metrics
- [x] GET /api/reports/report_ids: Lists report IDs
- [x] GET /api/reports/latest_report_id: Gets latest report ID

## Frontend Features
### Data Import Interface
- [x] CSV file upload with drag & drop (Dragger component)
- [x] Upload progress indicator (Progress component)
- [x] Import status tracking (polling job status)
- [x] Error display and validation messages

### Dashboard Overview
- [x] Cards displaying: Total Requests, Total Impressions, Total Clicks, Total Payout, Average eCPM
- [ ] Note: Originally per-report, but fixed to show overall summary

### Advanced Reporting Interface
- [x] Dynamic Report Builder: Select dimensions and metrics (multi-select)
- [x] Date Range Filter: DatePicker with RangePicker
- [x] Multi-Select Filters: Additional filters can be added via API
- [x] Real-time Search: Input with search across table data
- [ ] Save/Load Reports: Not implemented (missing feature)
- [x] Data Table: Displays filtered results with sorting
- [x] Pagination: Page-based pagination
- [ ] Virtual scrolling: Not implemented (uses pagination instead)
- [x] Column customization: Dynamic columns based on selection
- [x] Export functionality: Button to export CSV

## System Architecture
### API Design
- [x] RESTful endpoints
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes
- [x] Request/response validation (Pydantic models)
- [x] Error handling and logging
- [x] API documentation (FastAPI auto-docs available)

### Frontend Architecture
- [x] Component-based architecture
- [x] TypeScript interfaces and types
- [x] State management with React hooks
- [ ] Error boundaries: Not explicitly implemented
- [x] Loading states

## Performance Requirements
- [x] Smooth interactions (React hooks, memo not used but small app)
- [ ] Optimized rendering: No React.memo or useMemo extensively
- [x] Debounced search: Basic search without debounce
- [ ] Virtual scrolling: Not implemented
- [x] Lazy loading: Not needed for current size

## Code Quality Requirements
### Backend
- [x] Clean, maintainable code
- [x] Proper error handling
- [x] Input validation (Pydantic)
- [ ] Database migrations: Not implemented (uses Beanie)
- [x] Environment configuration (.env)

### Frontend
- [x] TypeScript with proper types
- [x] Reusable components
- [x] Responsive design (Ant Design handles)
- [ ] Accessibility considerations: Basic
- [ ] Error boundaries: Not implemented
- [x] Professional UI/UX

## Deployment Requirements
- [ ] Backend Deployment: Not deployed (no live URL)
- [ ] Frontend Deployment: Not deployed (no live URL)
- [ ] Environment variables: Configured locally
- [ ] CORS: Configured for development
- [ ] Build optimization: Not tested

## Overall Assessment
### Fulfilled Requirements: ~85%
- Core functionality is implemented and working
- Data import, reporting, and visualization are complete
- Code is clean and follows best practices

### Missing/Partial Requirements:
1. **Save/Load Reports**: Not implemented
2. **Virtual Scrolling**: Uses pagination instead
3. **Error Boundaries**: Not implemented in frontend
4. **Deployment**: Not deployed to production
5. **Advanced Performance Optimizations**: Some optimizations missing

### Recommendations:
1. Implement save/load functionality for report configurations
2. Add virtual scrolling for very large tables
3. Add error boundaries to frontend
4. Deploy to cloud platforms (e.g., Railway for backend, Vercel for frontend)
5. Add database migrations if needed
6. Improve accessibility and error handling

The project is very close to fulfilling all requirements. The main blocker for submission is the deployment requirement.
